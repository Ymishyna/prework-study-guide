     <ul>
       <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
       <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
       <li> The < p > element represents a paragraph or block of text. </li>
       <li> The < ul >, < ol >, and < li > elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.  </li>
       <li> The < img > element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The < img > element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
       <li>The < br > element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
       <li>Speaking of the hyperlink, the < a > element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>We can style HTML elements using the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a < style > element in the < head > element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
       <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
       <li>git commit -m "add starter code": a commit was created that captures a snapshot of the currently staged changes. </li>
       <li>git pull origin main: use the pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch. In our case, we are receiving a branch called main from the GitHub repository.

        c. It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work. Otherwise, you might be working on outdated code!</li>
        <li>git push origin feature/starter-code: command push to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch. When using the push command, you can create a new remote branch or add new changes to an existing branch.</li>
