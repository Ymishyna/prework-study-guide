The main keyword indicates the branch. In our case, we are receiving a branch called main from the GitHub repository.

        c. It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work. Otherwise, you might be working on outdated code!</li>
        <li>git push origin feature/starter-code: command push to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch. When using the push command, you can create a new remote branch or add new changes to an existing branch.</li>
